# Udacity Feed Reader Tester


 This project consists in learning about JavaScript testing, where we have a web-based application that reades RSS feeds.
 The goal is to complete the Jasmine test suites and write the remaining.
 This is an important part of the process and this practice is know as test-driven development.

## How to Run the App

1. Download or clone this repository.

2. Find the `index.html` file, and open the file in a modern browser.
